## Week 3 Homework

# Description
The main purpose of this project is to finish a random password generator that was started.  The HTML, CSS, and part of the JavaScript (JS) file were provided.

Upon starting the unfinished .js, I knew that I want to create a function that will display a prmopt asking how many letters the users would like their passwords to be.  

After that, I knew that there are certain requirements that the password needs to include: lower and upper cased alphabets, numerics, and symbols.  After deciding the requirements, there needs to be a confirm for each conditional requirements asking the users if they would like to include each of the requirements.

By the time the password generator is finished, I will have applied some of the ideas such as the "for" loop, "if-else" statements, the "while" condition,  creating an array, and writing "variables" and reference them to "functions".  All of these will enable me to program the "Generate a Password" button, so that the users will be able to create a randomized password upon clicking on the button.

Looking at the conditions and requirments for the password, I knew that I had to start out with defining the variables that will go into a main password array, where all the variables will be stored.

After that, upon clicking the button, the users will be greeted by a confirm tab, asking for the desired length of the password.  To set a limit, the password must be between 8 to 128 characters.  Anything less than 8 or more than 128 charcters will receive a statement reminding the users of the length requirement.  To limit the number of characters, I had decided to use the "while" condition to set the limit of the characters and an "if" statement to warn the user to enter a length.

After setting the length limit, the next part comes the conditions for the password: Should the password include lower cases, upper cases, numerics, and/or symbols?  I thought that each requirement is a yes-or-no statement, or a boulean (true or false), so I decided to use a window.confirm function.
